 mad lib code:
 You can run this code, and it will prompt you to enter the words one by one. After entering all the words, it will display the completed Mad Lib story.

  powerball number generator code:
Copy and paste this code into a Python environment, run it, and it will prompt the user if they want PowerBall numbers. If the user says yes, it will generate and display the numbers with the specified spacing. If the user says no, it will provide a farewell message.

 quiz bowl code:
Copy and paste this code into a Python environment, run it, and it will display each question from the dictionary, prompt the user to input their answer, and provide feedback on whether the answer is correct or not. The program will continue with the next question until all questions are completed.

I want to thank ChatGPT for completing this project in under 5 minutes when it would've taken me 5 hours to code it all by hand.
